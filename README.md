## Overview

Cloud computing is the backbone of modern digital systems. It enables organizations to build, deploy, and scale applications without owning physical infrastructure. This document introduces cloud computing from an engineering perspective, answering the most important questions: what it is, why it exists, when to use it, when not to, who should adopt it, and how organizations transition in and out of the cloud.

### What Is Cloud Computing?

Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources—compute, storage, databases, networking, security, and software—over the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.

Instead of provisioning physical servers and data centers, organizations consume cloud services from providers that operate large-scale global infrastructure. This is possible through the technology of Virtualization.

Key characteristics:

  On-demand self-service
  
  Broad network access
  
  Resource pooling
  
  Rapid elasticity and scalability
  
  Measured (usage-based) service

### Why Cloud Computing Exists

Cloud computing exists to solve fundamental limitations of traditional IT infrastructure:

High upfront capital costs, Slow provisioning cycles, Poor scalability, Complex disaster recovery, High operational overhead.

The cloud shifts IT from a capital expense (CapEx) model to an operational expense (OpEx) model, allowing organizations to focus on delivering value rather than managing hardware.







## Why Use Cloud Computing?

Organizations adopt cloud computing for scalability and elasticity, Faster time to market, High availability and resilience, Global reach, Built-in security and compliance options, Support for DevOps and automation, Innovation in AI, data, and analytics

## When to Use Cloud Computing

Cloud computing is best suited when, Workloads are variable or unpredictable, Applications require rapid scaling, Users are globally distributed, High availability is critical, Disaster recovery is required, Teams practice CI/CD and DevOps

When NOT to Use Cloud Computing

Cloud may not be ideal when Workloads are stable and predictable over long periods or Latency requirements are extremely strict, Regulatory or sovereignty restrictions prohibit cloud use, Skilled cloud engineers are unavailable, Costs are not actively monitored or optimized

## Cloud Trade-offs (Pros and Cons)
Advantages

No hardware procurement

Elastic scaling

Pay-per-use pricing

Built-in redundancy

Rapid experimentation

Challenges

Cost overruns if poorly managed

Vendor lock-in risks

Shared responsibility misunderstandings

Increased architectural complexity

## Who Should Adopt Cloud Computing?

Startups and scale-ups || Enterprises undergoing digital transformation || NGOs and public sector institutions || Research and education institutions || Remote and distributed teams

## Can Organizations Leave the Cloud?

Yes. Organizations may exit or reduce cloud usage due to Cost optimization decisions, Regulatory changes, Performance requirements, Strategic shifts. This is known as 'cloud repatriation'. Successful exits require portable architectures, Avoidance of tight vendor lock-in, Clear data ownership strategies
